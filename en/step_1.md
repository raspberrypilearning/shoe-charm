Tinkercard is a 3D model editor that you can use in a web browser on a computer or tablet. 

You drag and drop code blocks to design 3D models that can be exported for 3D printing. 

### You will need (optional)

+ A 3D printer and filament. Solid colours work best. The charm doesn't use a lot of filament and is small and quick to 3D print. 
+ A badge pin, or double-sided sticky tape.
