## 3D print your charm

Tinkercad can print directly to supported 3D printers and can also export an `.STL` file for 3D printing.

**Note**: The colour of your charm will be the colour of the filament you use. 
Changing the colour of your objects in Tinkercad will not change the filament colour.

The one you choose will depend on the 3D printer that you are using.
